# Leetcode_scraper
A powerful Selenium-based Python script that automatically scrapes editorials and/or community solutions from the top 100 LeetCode problems. If an editorial is unavailable for a problem, it intelligently falls back to extract the most relevant community solution instead. All extracted content is saved in organized .txt files and finally zipped into a single archive.
